# write up

The stacking of images at a bit or pixel level can be done using softwares like stegsolve.

We install the software and open one of the images.

Then we select the analyse option and click on the image combine feature.

Now we we select the other image and try various layers, planes and inversions. We get our required output in the ADD option.
