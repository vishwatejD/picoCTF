### WRITE UP
First we inspect the site for any information using `ctrl+shift+I`
We only find the style.css file inside.
We  then try to login in using a random username and password. But we get log in failed.

Now if we check the source code. we find _**login.php**_ and _**secure.js**_ inside.

And inside secure.js we find the password and the username.

If we use this credentials to login once again we get the final flag.

FLAG:- picoCTF{j5_15_7r4n5p4r3n7_a8788e61}
