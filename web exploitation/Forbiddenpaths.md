# FORBIDDEN PATHS
## GOAL

Can you get the flag? Here's the website. We know that the website files live in /usr/share/nginx/html/ and the flag is at /flag.txt but the website is filtering absolute file paths. Can you get past the filter to read the flag?

### WRITEUP:-

If we try to access the file it shows not authorised.
Thus we use the relative path or path traversal.

The sequence `../` is valid within a file path, and means to step up one level in the directory structure.

The four consecutive ../ sequences step up from /html to the filesystem root, thus the file can be read
  
  `../../../../flag.txt`

Thus by clicking read we get the flag as 

**picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}**
