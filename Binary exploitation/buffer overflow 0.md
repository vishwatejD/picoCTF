# buffer overflow 0
## GOAL
Smash the stack Let's start off simple, can you overflow the correct buffer? The program is available here. You can view source here. And connect with it using: 
`nc saturn.picoctf.net 65443`

## HINTS
1. How can you trigger the flag to print?
2. If you try to do the math by hand, maybe try and add a few more characters. Sometimes there are things you aren't expecting.
3. `Run man` gets and read the BUGS section. How many characters can the program really read?
