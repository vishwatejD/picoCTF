`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 62073`

## HINTS
1.Use 'w','a','s','d' to move around.

2. There may be secret commands to make your life easy.



## WRITE UP

I first used the command given, `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 62073`



Then used the w,a,s,d keys to move the `@` to the `X`.



I just got `You Win!` but no flag.



Then I tried to read the code behind this output. I found using the command `$ file game` that this file is a elf 32 bit excecutable file.



~~ searched online for decompilers of that type of file~~

> RESOURCE USED :- https://dogbolt.org/



I added the file in the decompiler and went through the code.

The variable local_aa4 is responsible for the position of the `@` and the flag. It says that the value of that variable must not be 0. Thus we must move the `@` 

`if (local_aa4 != '\0') {
    puts("flage");
    win();
    fflush(_stdout);`
