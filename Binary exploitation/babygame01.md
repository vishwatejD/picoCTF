Welcome to BabyGame! Navigate around the map and see what you can find! The game is available to download here. There is no source available, so you'll have to figure your way around the map. You can connect with it using 

`$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 62073`

## HINTS
1.Use 'w','a','s','d' to move around.

2. There may be secret commands to make your life easy.



## WRITE UP

I first used the command given, `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 62073`



Then used the w,a,s,d keys to move the `@` to the `X`.



I just got `You Win!` but no flag.



Then I tried to read the code behind this output. I found using the command `$ file game` that this file is a elf 32 bit excecutable file.



~~ searched online for decompilers of that type of file~~

> RESOURCE USED :- https://dogbolt.org/



I added the file in the decompiler and went through the code.

The variable local_aa4 is responsible for then value of the flag. It says that the value of that variable must not be 0. In the code Thus we must move the `@`  to a place where we get the flag. ~~ I tried moving it all around the map but no flag. I thought what if the flag is outside the map, by chance i got the flag when the @ is moved 4 places to the left of point (0,0). I searched online for what the logic behind that is and found that all the following commands start at 0 thus the flag must be before 0.~~

`if (local_aa4 != '\0') {
    puts("flage");
    win();
    fflush(_stdout);`
