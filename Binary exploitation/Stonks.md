# Stonks
## Goal
I decided to try something noone else has before. I made a bot to automatically trade stonks for me using AI and machine learning. I wouldn't believe you if you told me it's unsecure! vuln.c 

`nc mercury.picoctf.net 16439`
## HINTS
Okay, maybe I'd believe you if you find my API key.

## WRITE UP

Use the netcat command given in the question

`$ nc mercury.picoctf.net 16439`

~~ I searched online and got to know how the api key is stored on the stack~~



We can access the api key by using `%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x%x`

This string of text is in hexadecimal format, this can be converted to ascii by using online converters.

But, now the problem is the flag is encrypted.
Every four characters are reversed.

This can be decrypted manually by reversing every four characters.
